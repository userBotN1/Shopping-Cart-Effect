This project showcases a single webpage featuring a shopping cart effect.
Implemented essential features to handle user interactions effectively, such as selecting/de-selecting items, updating the final checkout amount dynamically, and checking whether the checkout amount meets the threshold for delivery.
Additionally, an engaging visual effect has been incorporated wherein selected items mimic jumping into the shopping cart located at the bottom of the page.
